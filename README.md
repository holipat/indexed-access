# Student-Index-System

This project implements a simple student management system with indexed file access. It allows users to:

- Create a student database file
- Add new students
- Retrieve student data using indexed access

## Features:

- **Indexed Access**: Efficient search using an index file that maps student numbers to their records' offsets in the student data file.
- **Add Students**: Adds new student records with basic information such as number, name, surname, and department.
- **Create & Search Files**: Creates a new student file and allows searching for students by their number.
